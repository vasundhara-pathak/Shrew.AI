# Shrew.AI
College Project
An A.I. that learns to traverse a maze using the genetic algorithm.

Using the genetic algorithm, the A.I. "learns" to navigate the maze by applying natural selection and survival of the fittest concepts. The foundation of natural selection is a single generation of A.I.s (all randomly selected), and as they navigate the maze, the fittest is chosen by examining the shortest distance to the checkpoint in the fewest moves. They can 'remember' old directions and pass on genes of efficiency to future generations by increasing the number of moves available to them every five generations so that they master the moves more efficiently (incremental learning).

When the evolution speed is set to 6, it takes the A.I. roughly 50 generations to reach the first checkpoint, 120 generations to reach the second, and so on. Never skipping a checkpoint or dying in the face of attackers, the learning process eventually succeeds. 
Please be patient with Shrew A.I.; as it took us approximately 6 million years to evolve.

Why the name Shrew? 
i've named this game after the Pygmy shrews, sci. Sorex hoyi, that are distributed throughout the boreal region of North America. The northern extent of the species' geographic range spans from Alaska to the east coast of Canada south of the tundra. It ranges as far south as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and the Appalachian Mountains of the northeastern United States. (Baker, 1983; Kurta, 1995; Nowak, 1999)
Pygmy shrews have one of the fastest metabolisms in the animal kingdom and can eat upto more than thrice their weight. 

Hence the name, as there are three checkpoints (food stops) and the game is fast and easy to play!
